# InfoDrop

Made this app to figure out how generating PDF files in NodeJS works

Mainly functions as a stamp generator that can be used to create an easily printable file that can be taped to packages before mailing them

Run `npm start` to start regularly or `npm run-script devstart` to start with nodemon

Refer to [docs](http://pdfkit.org/) for changes to generated PDF file
